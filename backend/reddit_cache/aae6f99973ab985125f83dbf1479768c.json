Take the Dutch Flat Trail, hike about 2 miles/900 feet of elevation/about 45 mins to the Scenic Overlook which is 2,457 feet elevation. These were the best views I\u2019ve seen in San Jose. It felt like I was high without taking drugs lol\n\nhttps://parks.sccgov.org/sites/g/files/exjcpb961/files/documents/Joseph%20D%20Grant%20Guide%20Map.pdf",

Also the Grandview restaurant along the way out to Mt. Ham.\n\nHunters Point at Fremont Older is an easy quick hike with modest views.\n\nMission Peak is a classic, you can see clear up to sf and Oakland on a clear day. though I would recommend starting from Ohlone college rather  than the mission entrance and go on a non-holiday weekend, or a weekday if you can swing it. It gets packed. Conversely, you could hike out to Mission Peak From Ed Levin Co. Park\n\nMt Umunhum, another long drive or bike ride or hike with view of the valley + Monterey bay",
